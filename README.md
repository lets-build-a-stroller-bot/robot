# Let's Build a Stroller Bot

StrollerBot is a collaborative learning project for robotics.  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you started.

There are a couple of different ways to get started with strollerbot. A [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container can be run locally using the most current strollerbot docker image. Or you can SSH into the exploded robot prototype using the [Balena CLI](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli).

### Exploded Robot Prototype

The exploded robot prototype is a barebones prototype that includes:

* a Jetson Nano Dev Kit card
* two motor controllers
* two motors

The goal of the this prototype is to start putting together the basic electronic components that will be needed by the end product / robot without having to invest in / build the hard ware to house it. This allows the stroller bot team to start developing the needed software, connect base components together, and get a better idea of the specifications and mechanical needs for the end robot.
